ans

First set up your an environmental variable for KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config.

[Step1 :-
export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config 
]

Then let's generate the file at that location. Your k3s.yaml file should NOT be world readable.. This is by-design. It should be owned by root and set to 0600. Instead copy the config locally as described here,

[Step2
mkdir ~/.kube 2> /dev/null
sudo k3s kubectl config view --raw > "$KUBECONFIG"
chmod 600 "$KUBECONFIG"
]
